# Student Directory
This was a Makers precourse exercise in which I built and interactive student directory console application for a fictional Schoold called the Villan's Accademy. 

The students directory script allows you to:
* input students and and details about that student and add them into a hash table.
* show details from the students hash table such as:
  * all students
  * students that name begins with a inputted letter
  * students that name is under n characters
  * students by cohort
* save the students to a csv file
* load students from a csv file

 The purpose of the exercise was to go through process of creating a project from scratch. 

## How to use
Run the following command in Power Shell or your command line interface of choice:

````shell
ruby directory.rb
````
Follow the onscreen prompts to use the application.
